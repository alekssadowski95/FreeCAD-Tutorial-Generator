# FreeCAD Tutorial Generator

Automatically generates a written step-by-step tutorial with graphics for a part created in FreeCAD Part Design.

NOBODY HAS EVER DONE THIS FOR ANY 3D CAD SOFTWARE, not even Solidworks, CATIA, Siemens NX, Solid Edge, PTC Creo, Onshape, Fusion 360, Inventor,... NOONE!!!

THIS IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND WORLDWIDE!!

The FreeCAD Tutorial Generator makes it easier to spread the word about projects made with FreeCAD.

The FreeCAD Tutorial Generator goes a step further than all hardware-open-source projects, making even the creation process of #FreeCAD projects #opensource and not only the result, allowing everyone to replicate them on their own.
